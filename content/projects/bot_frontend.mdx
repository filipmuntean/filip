I am currently developing the front end for the **Rolo-tutor project**, a chatbot-based educational tool, built specifically for teaching Python, using **React**, 

### My Tasks Involve:

- **Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Integration**: I am implementing user authentication using Microsoft OAuth 2.0, ensuring secure access to the chatbot for authenticated users only.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: I am building a dynamic interface to facilitate interactions, including the development of modal forms for student feedback submission.
- **Developer Dashboard**: I am creating a dashboard that allows developers to visualize and analyze student feedback effectively.

The project's database is hosted on **Google Cloud**, providing a robust and scalable backend for storing and processing data.
