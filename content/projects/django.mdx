Developed a Django-based UI to streamline the submission process for CEUR-WS proceedings. This drastically reduced the submission time, eliminating
the previous manual method.
• Designed and implemented the automated submission system that reduced the
submission processing time by 50%.
• Developed a scalable solution to automate the submission process on with the
CEUR-WS website which currently hosts 3,677 volumes.
• Minimized human error by automating data validation, resulting in a higher
accuracy rate of submissions.
• Developed a second UI leveraging the OpenReview API to scrape data from the
platform and cross-check user submissions
